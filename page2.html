        As the name suggests, Neotraditional tattoos are the evolution of traditional tattoos. Although physically
        distinct from American Traditional, Neo Traditional uses the same foundation of techniques to complete tattoos,
        such as heavy black ink outlining. Neo Traditional tattoos are influenced by art movements such as Ukiyo-e
        Japanese prints, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco. Neo Traditional tattoos are recognized for their complex, luxurious
        aesthetic, which frequently depicts flowers, women's portraits, animals, and other subjects. The main difference
        between traditional tattoos and neo traditional tattoos is that neo traditional tattoos often have a broader
        color palette and a broader range of motifs. Pieces done in this style are known for their lush, decorative
        details as well as the use of natural imagery such as florals and animals. Modern ink and machinery paved the
        way for the emergence of Neo-Traditional tattoo art. By the 1970â€™s, tattoo artists not only began to develop a
        wider array of ink colors, but also adopted more refined techniques which made it possible to design more
        intricately.

    <h1>WebTech Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Tattoo Directory</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>About:</span> My prospective website would be a directory for
        tattoo art and design.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Objective:</span> My objective is to inform users about the many
        aspects regarding getting a tattoo. I'd like to emphasize the difference
        between tattoo ideation, artist-search, preparation, care, and aftercare
        phases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Target Audience:</span> My target audience would be 18-24 gen-z
        users who are prospective tattoo clients that desire educational tattoo
        resources or artistic inspiration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Content:</span> Content may include links to local shops (within
        the Boston area) along with respective ratings, tattoo style
        explanations (i.e, American Traditional vs. Neo-Traditional vs. Japanese
        style, etc) as well as links to visuals, popular tattoo templates/ideas,
        as well as educational resources to the healing process of a tattoo

        A tattoo is a form of body modification made by inserting ink, dyes, and/or pigments, either indelible or
        temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to form a design. The art of making tattoos is known as tattooing.
        Tattoos comprise three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning), symbolic (with a specific
        meaning pertinent to the wearer), and pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item).

        When it comes to selecting the right style for a brand new tattoo, it is important to know key differences
        between them just walking into a shop and requesting something off the wall. The purpose of this site is to
        provide some insight on the most prominent tattoo styles in the industry today. After clicking through each
        style below, you'll be able to tell an old school piece from a neotraditional one at one glance, and see the
        differences between realism and surrealism without batting an eye.
